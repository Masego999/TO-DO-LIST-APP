# TO-DO-LIST-APP
In this to do list app I used html, css and javascript.We can write the new task in the input box and click on Add button then the new task will be added to the list. We can click n the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We did add a close icon to delete the particular task from the TO DO list.
